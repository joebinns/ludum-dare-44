# Dare to Dance

As 48 hours rapidly ticked towards the final 10 minute mark, all hope of elegant code had gone out the window...

The floor's come alive with zombies. Dance on the beat to ignite their disco spirit.

Dare to Dance is a Fast Paced Disco themed Rhythm Game.

This game was conceptualised and made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 44 game jam. The theme of the jam was 'your life is currency'.
